I've added two jumpers to the PCB so that the AT27C256R can be programmed from the cartridge.

- The very first version of the PCB came in the mail today.

- I've added an adapter board to go from the EPROM on the GBDSO cart (PLCC32) to a PDIP28. See the AT27C256R datasheet for the connections.

## 07/03/2019: 
The first version of the PCB doesn't fit in a game shell. I forgot the notch at the top right corner.  
The PCB is also thicker (1.6mm) than an official game (1mm).
